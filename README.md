# SQL-Bank-Transactions-Analysis
Use SQL to analyze bank transaction data for fraud detection, suspicious activity identification, and regulatory compliance. This project focuses on deep data analysis techniques to uncover anomalies, assess transaction patterns, and ensure financial security.

Project Tasks
 1️. **Fraud Detection & Suspicious Activity Analysis**
 Identify customers with multiple high-value withdrawals within a short time.
 Detect frequent small transactions leading to a large withdrawal (smurfing behavior).
 Find transactions with unusual locations or IP addresses that don’t match customer patterns.
 Identify multiple failed transactions within a short duration.
 Track card usage from multiple locations in an unreasonably short time (geographical inconsistency
fraud).

 2️. **Transaction Patterns & Customer Insights**
 Determine top 5 transaction modes used by customers.
 Find the average transaction amount per user and classify them into spending groups.
 Identify customers who suddenly start making high-value transactions.
 Analyze merchant categories to see where most transactions occur.
 
 3️. **Regulatory Compliance & Reporting**
 Identify transactions exceeding regulatory thresholds (e.g., $1️0,000).
 Track international transactions and check if they comply with banking policies.
 Flag accounts where transactions exceed declared income levels.
 Generate a suspicious transaction report for further investigation.

 **Expected Deliverables**
 SQL Queries & Reports for fraud detection, transaction trends, and compliance.
 Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) summarizing flagged transactions.


**Conclusion**:
This project provides real-world exposure to banking analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance
using SQL. It simulates the challenges faced by financial institutions and enhances analytical skills for highstakes environments. ****
